Installation of hquery requires two main source components, the query-composer and the query gateway.

The query composer is a web based application that provides the front end for creating, managing, and executing queries.  

Those queries are executed against the query gateway which exposes a query API, accepts queries, runs those queries against the patient data,
and returns the results of the query back to the query composer.

****************************************************

Common setup requirements for OSX and LINUX
  install ruby 1.9.2 or later
  install bundler 1.0.14 or later
  
****************************************************

1.	Ruby installation process for OSX and LINUX
  
  Ruby should be installed via RVM (Ruby Version Manager) when available. Details on rvm can be found at https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ including
  installation instructions.  The basic install procedure for RVM is as follows:
     
    OSX
      First you will need to install XCode see: http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/ or install from your OSX install disk.

      open a terminal and run
        bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)
        rvm install 1.9.2
        rvm use 1.9.2

    LINUX
       open a terminal and run
         apt-get install ruby rubygems
         apt-get install build-essential curl file zlib1g-dev libreadline5-dev libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev
         gem install rvm
         /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/rvm-install
         rvm install 1.9.2
         rvm use 1.9.2

Getting Ruby Directly
  Ruby can also be installed directly from the following without the use of RVM.  Under windows ruby version 1.8.7 should be used.

    http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

    The rails installer may be helpful under windows.
 
****************************************************

1w. WINDOWS - Download and install Railsinstaller
    
    a)	From cmd prompt issue following command
    set HTTP_PROXY=http://gatekeeper.mitre.org:80
    
    b) download and install railsinstaller
    
    http://railsinstaller.org/
	 Packages included in version 1.1.1 are: 
		Ruby 1.8.7-p334
		Rails 3.0.7
		Git 1.7.3.1
		Sqlite 3.7.3
		TinyTDS 0.4.5
		SQL Server support 3.0.14
		DevKit
	Follow the included directions and these packages should be successfully installed.
	
    c) download rubyinstaller-1.9.2-p180 to update the version of ruby
        available: http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
       1. install the ruby 1.9.2 installer
       2. after install is complete open the windows control panel, and open system, then select the "Advanced" tab
       3. click the environment variables button
       4. under system variables, find PATH.  Click edit, and add C:\Ruby192\bin; (make sure you have the trailing ';') to the BEGINNING of the path value
       5. restart your command prompt and type ruby -v to verify the version reports 1.9.2p180
       6. note, you will likely need to run set HTTP_proxy=http://gatekeeper.mitre.org:80 in the new prompt unless it's been set system wide
    d) install the ruby dev kit, also avaialble at
        http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
       The dev kit will allow building native gems.
       1. near the bottom of the page you should see a link for the dev kit
         DevKit-tdm-32-4.5.1-20101214-1400-sfx.exe
       2. If you don't have MinGW installed, install it to c:/MinGW
          available: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/
          install all components when prompted
       3. Running this exe will extract the contents.  You should extract the contents to c:\DevKit
       4. open a command prompt to the DevKit directory and run "ruby dk.rb init"
       5. Veryify the new file config.yml contains a reference to Ruby192
       6. run "ruby dk.rb install"
       7.Next you will want to run pi.bat in the postinstall directory

2.  Gem Update

Bundler install process
   Install ruby gems from:
     http://rubygems.org/pages/download
       1. download zip file
       2. unzip zip file
       3. in unzipped rubygems directory, run "ruby setup.rb"


   Bundler (http://gembundler.com/) is a Ruby Gem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems) that is used to manager the dependencies of a ruby application.  

   The bundler gem can be installed by running the following command in the terminal once ruby has been installed.
   
   $  gem install bundler

****************************************************

3.	Installing GIT

	NOTE FOR WINDOWS:  If you installed from the railsinstaller git will be installed so this step will not be needed

	In order to get access to the source code, you will require git.  If you do not already have git, it can be installed by following the directions at:

	http://git-scm.com/download

   ** MAYBE GITHUB SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ONCE IT'S THERE **
