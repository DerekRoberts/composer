# Toggle the USE_SSL_SERVER and USE_SSL_CLEINT variables in config/ssl_config.rb to enable/disable SSL support.
# The variable USE_SSL_SERVER configures encrypted browser access to the query-composer.
# The variable USE_SSL_CLIENT configures whether traffic between composer and gateway is SSL encrypted.  If it is
# being tunnelled through ssh, then is isn't necessary to also SSL encrypt it.
